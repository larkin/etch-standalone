# `etch-standalone`

This package exists solely to produce a single built artifact of [etch](https://github.com/atom/etch) wrapped in umd for direct usage in browsers or usage with requirejs, browserify, or webpack.

There's also a minified version for those who would prefer that.

Versions of etch-standalone should match releases of etch.

## Usage:

````
npm install etch-standalone
# contents:
ls -l node_modules/etch-standalone/dist
```
